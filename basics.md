## git Init
The `git init` command  initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place
a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.
			
## git Clone
The `git clone` command creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is
the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central
repository.
			
## git Add
The `git add_` command moves changes from the working directory to the staging
area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
			
## git Commit
The `git Commit ` takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.
Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
			
## git Status
The `git status_` command displays the state of the working directory and the
staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git
commit to see exactly what’s being included in the next snapshot.
			
## git 
The `git Log` command lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It
provides several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.
