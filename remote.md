git _____		Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with
				all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to
				integrate anything into your local repository. This gives you aa
				chance to inspect changes before merging them with your project.
				
git _____		Pulling is the automated version of `git _____`. It downloads a
				branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into
				the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.
				
git _____		Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It
				lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves
				as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn
				commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single
				changeset.
