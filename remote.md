git _____		Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with
				all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to
				integrate anything into your local repository. This givs

				as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn
				commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single
				changeset.
